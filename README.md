### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marcelo, and I hold a Bachelor's degree in **Science and Technology** from **UFABC**. From a young age, I have been fascinated by how technology can solve real-world problems, and this passion has driven me to explore software development and system optimization. I am currently completing my Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science**, also at UFABC. I am passionate about programming and technology, always eager to learn and explore new areas.Â 

Software developer with experience in creating and maintaining systems, working across all phases of the project lifecycle. I have worked on the development of platforms such as streaming solutions and e-learning (EAD) systems.

I have experience in deploying projects to production, providing technical support, and directly interacting with clients to gather requirements and propose solutions.

I am constantly seeking to optimize systems, always applying best development practices and aligning technology with the company's objectives.
